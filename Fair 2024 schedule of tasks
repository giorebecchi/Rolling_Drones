Tasks for Drones and Simulation Controller


###Drone-Specific Tasks

    Initialization

    Distribute drone implementations (impl) evenly across drones as per specifications. 🟢
    Set up Rust channels for communication between drones. 🟢
    Configure Packet Drop Rate (PDR) from the network initialization file (0-1 scale). 🟢

    Packet Handling

    Implement source routing for message forwarding:
        Verify the hops[hop_index] matches the drone's ID. 🔴
        Increment the hop_index and forward the packet to the next hop or terminate appropriately. 🟢
        Handle packet drops based on PDR and send Nack with type Dropped if necessary. 🟢
        Prioritize handling simulation controller commands over other messages. 🟢
        Handle MsgFragment, Ack, Nack, and flood-related packets according to protocol rules. 🟢

    Flooding Protocol

    Participate in the Network Discovery Protocol:
        Add the drone to the path_trace in FloodRequest. 🟢
        Forward the FloodRequest to neighbors or create a FloodResponse as required. 🟢
        Return topology information through FloodResponse packets. 🟢

    Simulation Events

    Emit PacketSent and PacketDropped events to the simulation controller. 🔴
    Use the simulation controller for error handling of lost Ack, Nack, and FloodResponse packets. 🔴

    Error Handling

    Send appropriate Nack types for routing or processing errors:
        ErrorInRouting 🟢
        UnexpectedRecipient 🟢
        DestinationIsDrone 🟢

Simulation Controller-Specific Tasks

    Communication Management

    Create and maintain unbounded Rust channels for all nodes. 🟢
    Issue commands to drones:
        Crash, RemoveSender, AddSender, SetPacketDropRate. 🟢
    Receive and process events from drones (PacketSent, PacketDropped, ControllerShortcut). 🟢

    Validation and Network Maintenance

    Ensure the network remains connected after any command: 🟠
    Validate client-drone and server-drone connectivity rules. 🟠

    Drone Crashes

    Implement drone crash behavior:
        Remove senders from crashed drones. 🟢
        Process and forward remaining packets in the crash state. 🟢
        Send ErrorInRouting Nack for other packets. 🟢
        Listen to Crash Drone should send back an error. 🔴

    Packet Routing

    Directly forward lost Ack, Nack, and FloodResponse packets to their destination. 🟢
