Clients - Chiara Strozzi

--Scrivi qua le funzionalità dei client e la scaletta delle cose da fare:
1. Web browser: they can retrieve the list of all text files from text server and can display the file chosen
   - access text server (sending a message to access the list)
   - retrieve and display the list (text, media and communication messages are ALL high-level msg which need to be serialized and re-assembled)
   - client sends message with a chosen text file to display, with the request if needed to also retrieve the referenced media
   - retrieve the chosen file and display it
   - if needed display the media referenced

2. Chat client: client register itself to the Communication server, it can retrieve the list of registered clients and initiate a chat with them.
   to initiate the chat it needs to send the message to the communication server specifying the destination client
   the server has to forward the message
   - register to server (send request message to server to register itself) ✅
   - retrieve the list of registered clients and display
   - send message to communication server specifying the destination client (message has to be fragmented first) ✅
   - end chat function? to end communication between 2 clients ✅

3. serialization, fragmentation and reassembling of the messages ✅
    - can introduce an Assembler as a sub-component ✅
    - when sending a message it needs to be serialized AND then fragmented if it exceeds a certain size ✅
    - when receiving a message the client needs to re-order the fragment and to re-assemble the message ✅
    - when a fragment arrives check if it has already arrived before adding to hashmap, if it has it has to copy the data in the vector,
    - when a client has received all the fragments and so re assembled all the message sends back an Ack

Simulation Control - Giovanni Rebecchi

--Scrivi qua le funzionalità del simulation control e la scaletta delle cose da fare:

1. Testare i droni comprati (fatto)
2. Front-end (con bevy?)
3. Testare rete di servers e clients con rete di droni
4. Collegare front-end a back-end
